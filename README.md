#####*The first Independent Scientific Register for Organizations and Researchers*

SCIENTILLA is: a free network for exchanging bibliographic metadata and a software in order to access to this network.

The network is designed for organizations and researchers to manage, share and promote metadata relating to their scientific publications. The data can be completely shared by all the members of the network and they will be always open.

Organizations and researchers can then work together helping to improve the quality and the accuracy of the bibliographic metadata.

The software is open source, editable and extensible.

The main functionalities can be summarized in four points:
* Organization of publications found on your installation
* Sharing of publications found on your installation
* Aggregation of publications in other remote installations
* Integration of publications available on other web resources

**Organization** 

The system allows users to enter metadata about their scientific publications (references) that are stored locally.
The references can be checked, corrected and "signed" by the authors and the institutions that produced them.

**Sharing** 

The system allows users to choose the references to share with the community (made up of all those who use SCIENTILLA) that are signed with their own profile.
Each installation (peer) can thus view the data of all the others.
With this mechanism, based on a peer-to-peer architecture, users can work together to clean and refine the data and identify his "fatherhood".
The Profile is the set of information that unequivocally identifies the user on the network SCIENTILLA.

**Aggregation**

The system allows each installation to collect and process the data shared by the other installations in order to extract information which will:
* know how many versions there are of the same reference and easily figure out the most trusted by the other users
* know the whole list of researchers authors of publications in the network
* know the complete list of organizations involved in publications in the network
* know the entire list of publications related to a researcher who has a profile on SCIENTILLA
* know the entire list of publications related to an organization who has a profile on SCIENTILLA
* know the entire list of publications related to an URL or IP address from which they were pick up (origin installation)

**Integration**

The system allows you to configure the interface with other data resources that share information about the scientific production in order to allow the user to search for references to his interest and import them.
In this way you can quickly define and complete your references list.


## IMPORTANT

SCIENTILLA is in Alpha phase. While we are writing documentation to help people using it, as well as contributing to the development, it is at moment recommended only for a technical audience.
